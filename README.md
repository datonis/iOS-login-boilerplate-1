iOS-login-boilerplate
=====================

Reusable login/registration code

###Why?

1. All login forms do the exact same thing.
2. It would be nice to have a hardened plug and play solution. 

###TODO

- Safely store credentials
- stay logged in (recreate session behind the scenes)
- Loading spinner/animation
- Custom segues
- Add to node js dummy server responses
- UI tweaks
